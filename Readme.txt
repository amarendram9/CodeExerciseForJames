// I used simple UI developed using angularJs
// I wrote angular controller tests using jasmine and used Chutzpah to run the ui tests.

// I did not use any external database for the data, i just created some lists with dummy data in data access layer and assume those lists acts as tables.

//I covered the tests for the methods in controller and repository using MSTest and Moq

//I created a dummy payment service with ValidateCreditCard and ChargePayment methods and assume it returns true.
